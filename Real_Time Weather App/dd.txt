IF city is entered:
    CALL forecast API with city name
    RECEIVE JSON with 5-day data (3-hour intervals)

    CREATE empty dictionary daily_temps

    FOR each forecast entry in JSON:
        GET date from dt_txt
        GET temperature from main.temp
        ADD temperature to that date’s list in daily_temps

    FOR each date in daily_temps:
        CALCULATE average temperature

    PLOT line chart with date vs average temperature
